# 1. Book Value Growth to Price

As we can see from _/analysis/book-value-growth-to-price.ipynb_, we can infer that the 3 year book value growth is the best prediction with MAE of 8,1%

**Therefore, with this foundings, the 3 year book value growth will be used in this finding**

# 2. Monthly Progress by Book Value

As we can see from _/analysis/monthly-progress-by-book-value.ipynb_, we could see that using different time interval would yield different progress mean

Month 2014 2017
1 0.871269 0.890891
2 0.891620 0.906478
3 0.881210 0.885344
4 0.906517 0.914775
5 0.900617 0.911699
6 0.881482 0.889714
7 0.897911 0.900157
8 0.927292 0.934079
9 0.932053 0.939477
10 0.959443 0.959753
11 0.979435 0.992403
12 0.990799 1.007348

**Therefore, in finding the suitable Monthly Progress Prediction, it is essential to find the most suitable year interval**
